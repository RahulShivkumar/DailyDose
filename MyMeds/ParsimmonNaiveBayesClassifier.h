 ## Sample usage

    ParsimmonNaiveBayesClassifier *classifier = [[ParsimmonNaiveBayesClassifier alloc] init];

 Train the classifier with some ham examples.

    [classifier trainWithText:@"nom nom ham" category:@"ham"];
    [classifier trainWithText:@"make sure to get the ham" category:@"ham"];
    [classifier trainWithText:@"please put the eggs in the fridge" category:@"ham"];

 Train the classifier with some spam examples.

    [classifier trainWithText:@"spammy spam spam" category:@"spam"];
    [classifier trainWithText:@"what does the fox say?" category:@"spam"];
    [classifier trainWithText:@"and fish go blub" category:@"spam"];

 Classify some new text. Is it ham or spam? In practice, you'd want to train with more examples first.

    NSString *firstExample = @"use the eggs in the fridge.";
    NSString *secondExample = @"what does the fish say?";
    NSLog(@"'%@' => %@", firstExample, [classifier classify:firstExample]);
    NSLog(@"'%@' => %@", secondExample, [classifier classify:secondExample]);

 Output:

    'use the eggs in the fridge.' => ham
    'what does the fish say?' => spam
